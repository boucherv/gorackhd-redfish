### Go bindings for RackHD Redfish API

## Description
gorackhd-redfish represents API bindings for Go that allow you to manage the [RackHD](https://github.com/RackHD/RackHD) Redfish API. This specific API is different than the [gorackhd bindings](https://github.com/emccode/gorackhd) as these are related to IPMI functions for individual machines. The intended functions are a direct implementation of what's available within the RackHD Redfish API. 

## Compatibility
gorackhd-redfish is created using [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) client generator. 

The client relies on a swagger spec file that is taken from RackHD's [on-http](https://github.com/RackHD/on-http) library and packaged at `/swagger-spec/redfish.yml`. As the swagger spec changes, this client will update as needed. 

## Installation & Creation of the Client
The client is found within the `/client` folder which is generated by go-swagger. To generate/install the client:
```
$ go get github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish
$ make
```

The Makefile utilizes [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to reference git commit `6b712512cbe` of [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) that has been tested and known to be working. The Makefile will generate a go-swagger directory in `/vendor/github.com/` and then create the client. 

## Environment Variables
| Name        | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `GORACKHD_ENDPOINT`      | the API endpoint. `localhost:9090` is used by default if not set             |


## Using the client

This sample script will retrieve (GET) all Roles. Take a look at `redfish_test.go` for more

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    httptransport "github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/httpkit/client"
    "github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/strfmt"

    apiclientRedfish "github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish/client"
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish/client/redfish_v1"
)

func main() {

    // create the transport
    transport := httptransport.New("localhost:9090", "/redfish/v1", []string{"http"})

    // configure the host. include port with environment variable. For instance the vagrant image would be localhost:9090
    if os.Getenv("GORACKHD_ENDPOINT") != "" {
        transport.Host = os.Getenv("GORACKHD_ENDPOINT")
    }

    // create the API client, with the transport
    client := apiclientRedfish.New(transport, strfmt.Default)

    //use any function to do REST operations
    resp, err := client.RedfishV1.GetRoles(nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp.Payload)
}

```

### Use the client to POST
Import the `redfish_v1` library for all the functions, then also import the `models` for the pre-defined structs needed for payloads.:
```
import (
    ...
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish/client/redfish_v1"
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish/models"
    ...
)
```

### Use the client to fetch (GET) individual items

Import the library for what you are trying to retrieve:
```
import (
    ...
    "github.com/emccode/gorackhd-redfish/client/redfish_v1"
    ...
)
```

Lookup the params that are required in a struct:
```
resp, err := client.RedfishV1.GetSystem(&redfish_v1.GetSystemParams{Identifier: "57154fe9d67951e70958c213"})
if err != nil {
      log.Fatal(err)
}
    
fmt.Printf("%#v\n", resp.Payload.PowerState)

```

## Contribution
Create a fork of the project into your own repository. 

Run the tests provided in `redfish_test.go` to verify GET/POST still function (change the NodeID accordingly):
```
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestRedfishGetRolesOperation -v
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestRedfishGetPowerStatus -v
env DEBUG=1 go test -run TestRedfishShutdown -v
```

If tests do not pass, please create an issue so it can be addressed or fix and create a PR.

If all tests pass, make changes and create a pull request with a description on what was added or removed and details explaining the changes in lines of code. If approved, project owners will merge it.
